## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Accessibility

### What I learned

- Interesting to work with DOM tree through replacing existing elements to others.
- Still didn't find solution about accessibility of all hidden inputs through their labels. (no solution about TABing through all of them)
- From the other hand : now screen reader can work better with hidden information (now it is not only "one", "two", ...., but "1 star", "2 stars, etc.")
